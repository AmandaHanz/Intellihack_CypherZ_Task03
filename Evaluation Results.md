## ‚è±Ô∏è Processing Performance
```python
print(f"Processing Time: {time.time() - start_time:.2f} seconds")
# Output: Processing Time: 418.98 seconds
```

## üß† Memory and Disk Usage
```python
import psutil

print(f"Memory Usage: {psutil.virtual_memory().percent}%")
print(f"Disk Usage: {psutil.disk_usage('/content/offload').percent}%")
```
- **Memory Usage:** 88.6%
- **Disk Usage:** 42.0%

## üîç Insights
- The model's memory usage is high, suggesting the need for optimization if deploying on resource-constrained environments.
- Disk usage remains moderate, indicating that storage is not a bottleneck.
- Inference speed can be further optimized by leveraging quantization and possibly implementing mixed precision during inference.
